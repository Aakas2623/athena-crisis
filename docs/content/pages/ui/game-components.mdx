# Game Components

The Athena Crisis renderer was written for fun in JavaScript and CSS from scratch without experience in building game engines. It then ended up being a real game. _Oops._ Anyway, it's been fun to push web technologies to the max and optimize every detail, so let's explore some of the core components!

Most of the UI and game rendering can be found in the [`hera`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/hera) top level folder. Athena Crisis renders almost the entire game using just plain React, DOM and CSS. Only the map tiles, fog and decorations are using a `canvas` Element. Even then, all three are rendered using different `canvas` elements that are laid on top of each other. The entry point to render a map is the [`Map`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/hera/Map.tsx) component.

## Tiles, Fog and Decorations

Building a renderer with basic web technologies makes it easier to study how to build a game. It's not the most efficient approach, but it's a great way to learn. All the "static content" is rendered using `<canvas>` through these components:

- [`Tiles`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/hera/Tiles.tsx) for rendering tiles.
- [`Decorators`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/hera/Decorators.tsx) for decorations.
- [`Fog`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/hera/Fog.tsx) for fog that overlays the map and blends into everything.

_If you are a fan of web development, check out how the fog layer is implemented._

## Units & Buildings

Units and Buildings are interactable entities. Both are making use of somewhat complex CSS like `mask-image`, `filter` and `transform` and are therefore slightly harder to replicate when building a game engine and renderer from scratch. In a way, CSS was used as if it was a shader language. Their implementation can be found here:

- [`Unit`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/hera/Unit.tsx)
- [`Building`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/hera/Building.tsx)

Here are some examples of units as they are rendered on a map in the game. You can click them to show the [`GameDialog`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/hera/ui/GameDialog.tsx) as it is rendered in the game when right-clicking or long-pressing a field:

<ClientComponent
  module={lazy(() => import('../../examples/entities-example.tsx'))}
/>

## Portraits

Portraits are rendered using the [`Portrait`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/hera/character/Portrait.tsx) component:

```tsx
// [!include ~/examples/portraits-example.tsx:portraits]
```

<ClientComponent
  module={lazy(() => import('../../examples/portraits-example.tsx'))}
/>
