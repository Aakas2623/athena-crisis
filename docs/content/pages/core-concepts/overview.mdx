# Core Concepts – Overview

This section dives into the core concepts of the codebase to give you a high-level overview of how Athena Crisis works. The technical walkthroughs primarily cover these three top level folders in the repository:

- [`athena`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/athena) → Data structures and algorithms for manipulating _map_ state (_client/server_).
- [`apollo`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/apollo) → Data structures and algorithms for manipulating _game_ state (_client/server_).
- [`hera`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/tree/main/hera) → Game engine and rendering (_client_).
